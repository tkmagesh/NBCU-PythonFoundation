# Variables

1. **No need to declare types**  
   Python figures it out for you:  
   ```python
   x = 10      # int  
   name = "Sam"  # str
   ```

2. **Case-sensitive**  
   `Name` and `name` are different.

3. **Can change types**  
   ```python
   x = 10  
   x = "ten"  # Now it's a string
   ```

4. **Naming rules**  
   - Start with a letter or underscore (`_`)  
   - No special characters (`@`, `$`, etc.)  
   - Can't use keywords like `if`, `for`, `class`

5. **Use `=` for assignment**  
   ```python
   age = 25
   ```

6. **Multiple assignments**  
   ```python
   a, b = 1, 2
   ```

7. **Swap variables easily**  
   ```python
   a, b = b, a
   ```
